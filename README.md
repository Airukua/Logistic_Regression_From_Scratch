# Logistic Regression From Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using Python. The notebook demonstrates step-by-step how to build a logistic regression model without relying on external machine learning libraries, making it a valuable resource for understanding the underlying mathematics and programming logic.

## Features

- Implements logistic regression using only fundamental Python libraries (e.g., NumPy).
- Includes key steps such as data preprocessing, hypothesis function, cost computation, gradient descent optimization, and model evaluation.
- Provides a clear and modular approach to understanding the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (can be installed using `pip`):
  - NumPy

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   jupyter notebook Logistic_Regression_From_Scratch.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the implementation.

## Structure of the Notebook

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare and preprocess the dataset for logistic regression.
2. **Model Implementation**: Define the hypothesis function, cost function, and gradient descent algorithm.
3. **Training the Model**: Train the logistic regression model on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this notebook, you will:
- Gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of logistic regression.
- Learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- Strengthen your Python programming and numerical computation skills.
